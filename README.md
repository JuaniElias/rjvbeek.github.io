# Naturalist role tracker
Naturalist role tracker for Red Dead Online, by Robbert van Beek

This tool primarily helps keeping track of all animals you have sampled and stamped for your much-needed RDO$. It is also possible to track all other animal properties required to complete the Animal Field Guide.

Designed for mobile.

Special thanks to Nick for valuable ideas, input and testing.

Thanks to u/The_Hateful_Kate for all her work on legendary animal hunting, thanks for sharing to improve this tracker.
